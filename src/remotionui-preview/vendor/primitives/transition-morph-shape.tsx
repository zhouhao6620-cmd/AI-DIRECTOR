 * channel switched off. The arriving scene is revealed through a shape that
 * both grows and changes form, so the reveal has a silhouette rather than an
 * edge — a circle that only grows is `transition-circle-reveal`.
 *
 * `from` and `to` take the shared `MORPH_SHAPES` presets, which are authored on
 * one box with matched curve counts. Hand-authored pairs work too, but a pair
 * with mismatched segment counts interpolates into geometry that is valid SVG
 * and nonsense on screen.

 * diagonal width reaches only `1/√2` of that along 45°, so it lands with the
 * frame's four corners still showing the *previous* scene, then pops. These
 * are the geometric figures, rounded up a little:
 *
 * - `circle` / `square` cover at 1.0 — a shape that fills its own box.
 * - `diamond` needs `(w + h) / diagonal`, ~1.36 at 16:9, so 1.42 covers 9:16 too.
 * - `triangle` is the worst case; it has to grow well past the frame before its
 *   short side clears the bottom corners.
 * - `blob` is inset from its box on every side, so it needs a little slack.
