 * threshold, so the covered text is never briefly unreadable.
 *
 * The stroke is built the way ink lands rather than as a filled rectangle:
 * feathered top and bottom edges, fibre striations running along the stroke,
 * and a soft leading edge held off vertical by `tilt`. The band itself is never
 * rotated — rotating each word's box is what turns a joined phrase into a
 * staircase of offset rectangles.

 * same on every line, so the striations and the feather run through a word join
 * without a seam and a wrapped phrase carries one continuous stroke.
