 * animation one. The track holds identical copies of the text, each carrying
 * its own trailing gap, so every copy is exactly the same width — one tile.
 * Shifting the track by one tile therefore lands each copy precisely where its
 * neighbour stood, which is the same picture. The shift is written as a
 * percentage of the track, so that identity holds off the measured text width
 * entirely: a bad measurement makes the loop slightly fast or slow and can
 * never make it jump.
 *
 * Measuring the tile in pixels and shifting by that many, or shifting half a
 * track that was laid out with gaps only *between* copies, both leave the wrap
 * a fraction of a gap short — a hitch once per loop, on every loop.
