 * Strikes out one phrase and puts another in its place — the correction gesture.
 *
 * The whole component is the timing relationship between three beats, and they
 * run in order rather than as one cross-fade:
 *
 * 1. **The stroke travels.** `strikeDurationInFrames` across the full width of
 *    `from`, on an ease-in-out, because a hand accelerates off the first letter
 *    and decelerates onto the last. It is drawn once, at full length, so the
 *    reader sees the old phrase cancelled before anything moves.
 * 2. **The old phrase leaves.** After `holdInFrames` it lifts by `travel` and
 *    fades on an ease-in. The stroke leaves inside that layer rather than being
 *    switched off — a rule that vanishes on its own frame reads as a glitch,
 *    while one that travels out with the text it cancelled reads as one object.
 * 3. **The new phrase arrives**, `replaceDelayInFrames` after the stroke lands,
 *    rising from `travel` below.
 *
 * The defaults open the arrival as the departure passes half, which is the
 * narrow window where the line is neither empty nor doubled. Opacity leads in
 * both directions — gone at 62% of the lift, complete at 55% of the rise — so by
 * the time the new phrase is readable the old one has gone, and while both are
 * faint they are travelling in opposite directions. Push `replaceDelayInFrames`
 * past `holdInFrames + departDurationInFrames` and the line goes briefly empty,
 * which reads as a dropout rather than a beat.
 *
 * Both phrases occupy the same grid cell, so the box is as wide as the longer of
 * the two for the whole shot and a centred line never reflows on the swap.
