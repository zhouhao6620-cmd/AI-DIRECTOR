 * by default — a shake that keeps going is a vibration, and the emphasis is
 * gone within half a second of the hit. Pass `repeatEveryInFrames` when the
 * shake is riding a beat.
 *
 * `punch` scales on the same envelope but with the opposite sign at the start,
 * which is the compression an impact actually produces; without it a shake
 * looks like the camera moved rather than the element being hit.
