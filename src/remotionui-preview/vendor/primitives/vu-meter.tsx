 * the frequencies are doing, and this shows only how loud it is. That is the
 * reading an engineer actually watches, and the one that still works at 40px
 * wide in the corner of a frame.
 *
 * Peak hold is what makes a meter useful — a transient that lights the top
 * segment for a single frame is invisible at 30fps. The marker comes from the
 * decaying peaks the audio library already tracks, so it is reconstructed from
 * the waveform on every frame rather than held in component state: a render is
 * stateless and may start on any frame, and a ref-held marker would differ
 * between a preview scrub and a full render.
