 * every cell does the same thing is one big flashing rectangle, and the point
 * of a grid is that different parts of it can disagree. `mapping` decides how
 * the spectrum is laid over the geometry — left to right, or outward from the
 * centre, which reads as a pulse travelling through the grid on the kick.
 *
 * Cells also carry their band's *peak*, dimmed, under the live level. It is the
 * same trick as a peak-hold meter: at 30fps a one-frame transient is invisible,
 * and the decaying trace is what makes the beat legible.
