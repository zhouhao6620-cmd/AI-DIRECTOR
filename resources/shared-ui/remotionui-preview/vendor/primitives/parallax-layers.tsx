 * illusion comes from planes moving at different rates against each other, so
 * one driver has to feed all of them. Each plane's offset is `depth × travel`,
 * which means depth is the only number a caller has to think about, and a plane
 * at `depth={0}` is the focal plane everything else moves relative to.
 *
 * The sweep runs from -0.5 to 0.5, so the middle of the window is the layout
 * you composed — planes are offset in both directions around it rather than
 * starting in frame and sliding out.
