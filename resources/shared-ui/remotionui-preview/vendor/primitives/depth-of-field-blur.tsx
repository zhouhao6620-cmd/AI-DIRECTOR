 * Spatial, unlike `blur-focus-in`, which resolves a single piece of type: here
 * every plane is blurred by its *distance from the focal plane*, so racking the
 * focus pulls one layer in exactly as it pushes another out. That relationship
 * is the shot — blurring one element on its own reads as an effect, not as a
 * camera.
 *
 * Two details do most of the convincing. Defocused planes dim slightly, because
 * a lens spreads the same light over a larger circle of confusion; and they
 * scale slightly, which is the focus breathing every real lens has. Both are
 * small enough to be invisible on their own and obvious by their absence.
