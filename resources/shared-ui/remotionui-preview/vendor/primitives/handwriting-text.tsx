 * stroking a real outline — for a signature or a logogram, where the stroke
 * order is the point, give `path-draw` the actual path.
 *
 * `order` is not a prop: writing runs left to right, and re-ranking the stagger
 * would produce a word that assembles out of sequence, which reads as a glitch
 * rather than as a hand.
 *
 * The default family is a script stack. Pass a webfont via `fontFamily` for a
 * result that is identical on every render machine — the generic `cursive`
 * fallback resolves to whatever the host has.
