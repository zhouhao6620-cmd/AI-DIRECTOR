 * Draws each letter as an outline, then floods it solid.
 *
 * Both layers are the same `<span>` of real text stacked on itself, so the
 * outline and the fill are guaranteed to be the same glyph at the same metrics
 * — tracing the fill with a second element positioned by hand drifts by a
 * fraction of a pixel and the outline reads as a drop shadow.
 *
 * The flood is a gradient mask rather than a `background-clip` trick because a
 * mask can move, and the moving edge is the effect.
 *
 * **The outline is not staggered; the fill is.** They ran on one clock first,
 * and a slow stagger then left the un-flooded half of the line completely
 * absent — the word looked truncated rather than outlined. The whole outline
 * therefore draws once, on `delayInFrames` + `outlineInFrames`, and the stagger
 * is spent entirely on the flood, which is the part the eye is meant to follow.
