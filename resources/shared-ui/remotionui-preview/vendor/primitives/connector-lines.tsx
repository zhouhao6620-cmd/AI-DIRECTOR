 * The edges between anchored elements, and nothing else.

 * between named points and leaves the boxes to whatever you position on top at
 * the same fractional coordinates. Anchors are fractions rather than pixels for
 * exactly that reason — the same anchor table drives the lines and the layout,
 * at any size.
 *
 * Edges draw in order with a stagger, each on its own `pathLength={1}`, so a
 * long curve and a short hop take the same time and the diagram assembles at an
 * even pace.
 *
 * A dashed edge cannot reveal itself with its own dash array — the array is
 * already spoken for — so it is revealed through a mask carrying the solid
 * stroke's draw-on, and its dashes march forward as it goes. `dashed` therefore
 * animates exactly like `solid`, rather than fading in as a finished line.
